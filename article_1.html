            <p>The Del Mar City Council voted unanimously in favor of a law that will prohibit e-bikes on sidewalks, parks, preserves, and restricted trails. This new law aims to lower e-bike injuries as many people ride recklessly on e-bikes. While many think the law is pointless, others are glad for the new law and hope it works. Now this law will not eliminate e-bike injuries but hopefully reduce the number of them. The law was also previously passed in surrounding cities for the same reason.</p>
