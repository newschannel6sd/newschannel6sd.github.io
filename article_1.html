            <p>San Diego is warming up and one result of this heat is snakes. Right now we are in what is called Snake Season and this means more snakes are going to appear on trails and even in peoples houses. Snakes aren't actually going to hurt you unless you disturb it. Most snakes are venomous; only rattle snakes are. If you encounter a snake, keep a distance and the snake wranglers as they will help remove the snake and relocate it. So next time you see a snake, remember, it's not out to hurt you.</p>
