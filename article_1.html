            <p>The popular dog memorial or Gwen’s garden at Dog Beach is being removed due to the new bridge project. The memorial was started 20 years ago and has been an important spot for many, as they leave decorated stones there to remember and honor their pet dog. The memorial was called to be removed by The California Coastal Committee, California Edison, and the City of Del Mar. The rocks from the memorial are currently in buckets at the fairgrounds while the plants from the memorial are supposed to be given to private Rancho Coastal gardens. There is also a petition against the removal which you can donate to by going to Change.org and typing “Gwen’s Garden”. As for now, there is no set location for the memorial to be rebuilt, but if there is, we will let you know.</p>
