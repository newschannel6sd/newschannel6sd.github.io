            <p>Adopting a pet may be one of the best choices you could make. Pets bring lots of joy and happiness to your life. They can also be healthy for you as you often take them for walks and play with them. When picking a pet, shelters are a great option. Adopting a pet from a shelter can provide a pet a second chance. Even if you can't adopt a pet, you can still donate to your shelter or foster a pet to help out.</p>
