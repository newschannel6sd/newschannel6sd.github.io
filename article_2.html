            <p>For over a century, the bridge that connects Solana beach and Del Mar has been in operation. But as you can tell, it's on its last legs. SANDAG says the bridge would require constant repairs and maintenance at a high cost. The Del Mar city council wants SANDAG to delay the project due to another railroad project also in Del Mar. The funding for the replacement is already there now all we need is the project to take action.</p>
