            <p>A new cleanup station in Solana Beach has been added to help lower the pollution and litter. The station, being launched on Earth Day, was created by the City of Solana Beach in partnership with Edco and Relic Coastal Collaborative. The station features baskets to walk and grab trash, and instructions on what to do. I also walked along the beach to try and find any trash to film, but was surprisingly unsuccessful. The project also followed a bay cleanup that happened on April 26th.</p>
